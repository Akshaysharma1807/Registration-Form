# Registration Form Web Application
As part of the Full-Stack Web Development Internship with Bharat Intern, I have successfully completed my 1st task. Welcome to the Registration Form Web Application repository! This project showcases a simple yet robust user registration form built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB.

# Features:
Form Validation: The registration form includes client-side validation using JavaScript to ensure data integrity before submission.
Phone Number Validation: Users are required to input a 10-digit phone number, and warnings are displayed if the input does not meet this criterion.
Password Strength Requirement: Passwords must contain a minimum of 8 characters, with warnings triggered if this requirement is not met.
MongoDB Integration: User registration data is securely stored in a MongoDB database for future access and management.

# Folder Structure:
HTML: Contains HTML files defining the structure of web pages (e.g., index.html, signup_successful.html).
CSS: Custom CSS stylesheets for enhancing the visual presentation and layout of the application.
js: Client-side JavaScript code responsible for form validation and user interaction.
public: Stores static assets such as images and background files to enrich the user interface.
server.js: Entry point for the Node.js server application, orchestrating routing and database interactions.
package.json: Configuration file listing project dependencies for seamless setup and execution.
